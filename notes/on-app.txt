to package lingtool including Python interpreter + machine learning libraries and models would be too large for an average mobile or web app

so instead I may have a cloud library with features for downloading the stack or having the cloud service convert for you

actually idk about that

instead the app should target the web browser using modern apis such as storage and webasm
